###  Customer Reviews Feature Engineering Project

##  Project Overview

As part of my Codecademy Machine Learning/AI Engineer learning journey, this project marks my progress through **Day 1 and Day 2**, focusing on transforming a raw customer reviews dataset into a machine learningâ€“ready format.

The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle**, containing 23,000+ womenâ€™s clothing e-commerce reviews. My task was to **engineer features** to prepare the data for future modeling and analysis.
